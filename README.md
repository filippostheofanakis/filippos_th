# Welcome to My GitHub Profile üëã

My name is Filippos, and I‚Äôm an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a story rooted not in a lifelong pursuit of technology, but in a serendipitous discovery of a passion that would redefine my professional path. It all began with a simple favor for a friend ‚Äì the need to build a homepage. Little did I know, this small project would be the catalyst for my deep dive into the world of coding.
